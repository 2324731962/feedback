# Commnad Line Options

Command line options is supported since v1.10.0, which can be used to call some of the functions of Snipaste.

Since 'Paste' is Snipaste's major feature, currently all options require a Snipaste instance running in background.

In other words, if Snipaste is not running in the background, all the command line options will be ignored. After Snipaste is started, start another Snipaste instance (which will exit right away) with the command line options, then the corresponding functions will be executed.

# Usage
    snipaste.exe [OPTION]

> For exampleï¼š

> Set the target of a shortcut (.lnk) to `/path/to/your/Snipaste.exe --snip-full`, or just run the command from another program, Snipaste will enter fullscreen capture mode.

> Note: Combining the 'Snip Options' and 'Paste Options' are not supported for the moment.
